           <h2>I am Responsive Designer &amp; Developer who thrives on visual storytelling. 
               When I'm not working, pursuing side projects or getting lost in the rabbit hole 
               of blogs &amp; books, I can be found traveling, hiking, rock climbing and playing frisbee with my dog.

                <p>I was born and raised in Denver, Colorado. Denver has a great mix of a small city 
                    plus has easy access to the great outdoors. The weather in Colorado is also great, 
                    as we get 300+ days of sunshine and experience all four seasons.

            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
                <p>My passion: I LOVE music and nature - Music is one of the most powerful and divserse methods 
                    for expression &amp; communication. In the meantime, I get my fix by going to lots &amp; lots 
                    of concerts. Even better when they are outdoor concerts. The most awesome concert I've ever 
                    been to was on the top of a mountain in the middle of July.

            <div class="div-3">
                <p>A fun fact: I feel like everyone who grows up in Colorado learned to ski or snowboard at a young 
                    age. I didn't learn until I was in my 20's and have been going consistenly every winter since.
